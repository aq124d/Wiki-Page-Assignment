## How to Use

1. **Open in Browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
   - No server or build tools required

2. **View Online**
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting service
   - Just upload the three files and you're done!

3. **Customize**
   - Edit `index.html` to change content
   - Modify `styles.css` for colors and styling
   - Update `script.js` for interactivity

## Customization Guide

### Colors
All colors are defined as CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #8B4513;      /* Brown */
    --secondary-color: #FF6B35;    /* Orange */
    --accent-color: #FFA500;       /* Light Orange */
    --sage-green: #7A9B8E;         /* Sage Green */
    /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

### Adding New Clubs
1. Copy a club card in `index.html`
2. Change the club header class (e.g., `eawc` to a new class like `newclub`)
3. Add styling for the new header in `styles.css`:
```css
.club-header.newclub {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #COLOR1 0%, #COLOR2 100%);
}
```
4. Update the content with club details

### Contact Form
